# AM Browser View Builder

AMB View is a lightweight AM data present layout, Admin users may create and manage views in AMB Builder. Power users can query all views in AMB Viewer. Guests can access a view via a URL that is shared by Admin users.

A view is created from AM schema (raw table), and a view only has a root table. All fields or links are related from root table.  

### Fields and Links
Fields and links are selected from AMB Build Schema. When a root table is selected, it cannot be changed. Fields and links are split into 3 groups:

- 1-M Links
- 1-1 Links
- Fields

All fields or 1-1 link's fields will be added in the same link. When querying data from this view, these fields are queried and displayed together. For example:

```
Root table: 
        amComputer
Fields:
        CPUType
        Portfolio.seAssignment
        Portfolio.Model.Name
        Portfolio.Brand.Name
```

When fields in 1-M Links are selected, a new link is created. For example:

```
1-M link:
        PhysicalDrivers
Field:
        lTotalSizeMb
```
```
1-M link:
        Portfolio.Softs
Field:
        Folder
        Model.Name
        Model.Brand.Name
```
