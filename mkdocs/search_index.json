No.    Is Active Directory authentication supported ?  Yes, AD can be the back-end LDAP server for authentication. However, AM Browser does not support NTLM/IWA authentication currently.    Can AMB co-exist with AM Web ?  Yes, AMB is a stand-alone module than AM Web.    How to restart AMB ?   AM REST Service - Run  4_startRestService.bat  to start the service and  5_stopRestService.bat  to stop the service.  AM Browser Service - Run  1_startService.bat  to start the service and  2_stopService.bat  to stop the service.",

This is the simplest deployment model; you may consider it the base model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical scaling mode\n\n\nThe Asset Manager vertical scaling model comprises multiple Asset Manager REST Services and multiple Asset Manager Browser Servers. Each REST Service sits in a single Tomcat instance. This implementation is typically used in small to medium-sized environments where hardware system resources are limited. This implementation does not have a limit to the number of client connections, as long as the Asset Manager Web Server has available system resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal scaling mode\n\n\nThe Asset Manager horizontal scaling model comprises multiple Asset Manager Web Services and multiple Asset Manager Web Tiers. Each Web Tier/Web Service sits in a single Tomcat instance. And the Tomcat instances are running on multiple servers.  \n\n\n\n\nA horizontal scaling implementation is typically used in large environments in which system scalability and resilience are concerned. A horizontal scaling implementation can support as many client connections as the sum of the individual Asset Manager instances can support. For example, if each instance can support 250 client connections and there are 4 instances, the system can support 1000 client connections. A horizontal scaling implementation has improved resilience features, such as the ability to stop and start the load balancer process without causing a total system outage and the ability to add a new servlet container process to a virtual group when the system is running.\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Asset Manager deployment diagram:\n\n\n\n\nIn this diagram, the following events occur:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Web browser connects to the Asset Manager Web Tier server.
